# file_integrity_verifier
This project is a simple Python-based File Integrity Checker. It computes and stores the hash values of files, allowing you to verify their integrity later by checking for any changes in the hash values. The project uses cryptographic hash functions to ensure that the files have not been altered or corrupted.
